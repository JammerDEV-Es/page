    "content": "I've been thinking about getting the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity. At 16 years old, I feel this is a great step in my learning journey and knowledge, in this field. \n \n  The reason I’m considering the eJPT is that it offers a hands-on approach, meaning I won’t just learn theory I’ll be able to apply it in real labs. \n \n  This is crucial for developing skills that are actually used in the professional world, like penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and troubleshooting security issues. \n \n As a starter license for €249, I think it's pretty good. And I don't think it will be too difficult for me to get this certification. I've done many labs from HTB, THM, and Vulnhub, so I won't have any problems. I've been doing this for a long time, this certification for me is just a way to stand out from the others who are new.",

    "content": "Finally, after hours of researching the eJPT, I've purchased the $149 USD annual INE subscription, which includes both the eJPT and the ICCA. Once I'm as informed as possible, I'll start using the course voucher and begin the three month countdown. I need to find a date that doesn't conflict with multiple things at my school, so I'll have to look into that now. I need to gather information and manage my time between my studies from now on."
